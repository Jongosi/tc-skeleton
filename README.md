TC_Skeleton
===========

EAV-based Magento module for database extension in custom modules. Tested for Magento CE 1.7.0.2.

Installation
============

1. Copy folder contents into Magento (on OSX, I recommend the ditto terminal command).
2. Flush cache at Admin > System > Cache Management.
3. Logout and login again.
4. Module is available for use.

Notes
=====

This is not a stand-alone module. It needs further development to be of any real use. The idea is that you make use of it as a starting point for your EAV-based module.
